                <h4 class="py-3">Recap</h4>
                <p>In this workshop, we have built, fixed and executed the Continuous Testing pipeline. Along with this hands-on implementation, you now also have a high-level understanding on testing in DevOps, including various testing stages, their objectives, challenges, enablers and some industry best practices.</p>
                <p>As committed in the ‘Objectives’ section, we have discussed the answers to the following questions in this workshop:</p>

                <div class="common-content">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Why QA is integral to a successful DevOps implementation.</li>
                      <li>How Continuous Testing is different in DevOps World.</li>
                      <li>What various types and stages of testing are essential for end-to-end quality assurance</li>
                        <li>How to build and execute the continuous testing pipeline</li>
                          <li>What are the various tooling alternatives, enablers and best practices in testing for DevOps</li>
                            <li>How to integrate open-source tools based automation suits with the pipeline</li>
                              <li>How to fix typical issues and fix your continuous testing pipeline</li>
                            </ul>                    
                </div>
                <h4 class="py-3">Next Steps</h4>
                <p>Now that you have built your own Continuous Testing Pipeline, we encourage you to build on the learnings from this Lab to expand your horizons on Continuous Testing. </p>
               
                <div class="common-content">
                  <ul>
                    <li>  Integrate your pipeline with Slack channel or Teams to easily monitor the events for your pipelines. Set up and manage subscriptions for builds, releases, YAML pipelines, pending approvals and more from the app and get notifications for these events in your Slack channels.</li>
                    <li>	Replace (or) append the tooling stack by creating your own automation test with new tools and frameworks</li>
                    <li>	Implement Code progression in the pipelines to demonstrate how code base moves form Dev to Production based on the quality gates at every stage</li>
                    <li>	Execute your mobile testing on Mobile Device Lab Like Perfecto (or) SauceLab (or) Browserstack</li>
                    <li>	Add additional testing types such as integration testing and UAT before releasing the code to production</li>
                    <li>	Integrate AI based BOTS for intelligent test execution based on the code committed and possible business impact.</li>
                    <li>	Re-orchestrate your pipeline by shifting left the non-functional testing i.e. execute the experience assurance at the Pre-Build stage itself</li>

                  </ul>

           <h3 class="text-blue pb-4"><strong>Clean-up</strong></h3>
          <p>When you are ready, just follow these last two steps to clean up the resources that were setup just for this workshop.<br><br>
            In order to prevent charges to your account, we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running, so you can examine the workshop a bit more, then please remember to do the clean-up when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an Azure account, forget about it, and spend free credits unknowingly.<br><br>
            Copy, paste and execute the following commands into Azure CLI terminal in sequence to commence the clean-up activity.<br><br>
            </p>
